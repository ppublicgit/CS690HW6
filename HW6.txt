This homework, much like the last homework, taught me how frustrating programming in C
can be. My background with C++ and Python has made me forget the complexities of low level
programming. Doing some of the simplest operations, such as substrings and string concatenation
are infuriating in C. I also learned how tricky it can be to handle network communication and
firewalls. I had to disable my firewalls on my computer to get the program to work. I also found
that the program would only work if my VPN on my computer was turned on. I have been unable to
do determine why this is. My best guess is I have somehow turned on a killswitch or firewall
setting that applies to the VPN and causes this issue. In any case, I left the VPN on and ran
the program. Overall the code seems fairly complex to me. The concept and design itself were
simple enough, but like most things in C, the implementation became quire difficult.
